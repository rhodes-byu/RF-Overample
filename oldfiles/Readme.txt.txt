These are the old files from the experiments involving archetypal analysis. Runner sets experiment parameters while cross_val.py within SupportFunctions implements them.

Columns identifies the columns used in the datasets folder for prior implementation through creation of a pickle file with load datasets.py 
(Note, load datasets.py needs be at the same level as the graphs folder to create the pickle file (running datasets.py directly, while within SupportFunctions for runner.py to run) (running runner.py)
